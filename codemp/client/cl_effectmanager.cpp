// cl_effectmanager.cpp -- engine-side front end for RPMod's /rpeffect command
//
// Effects tab: every effects/*.efx the filesystem can see, Base (the game's own pk3s)
// or Custom, played live in a window onto the world, then sent as "rpeffect once|add"
// at the player, at a spot picked with a free camera, or bolted to a tag or bone of a
// player or NPC. Bolted ones are shown on the real player or NPC before they are sent.
// Effects can wait to be sent together, and looping ones can be given a name.
// Active tab: the effects playing in the map, read from the server's "rpeffect list"
// reply, to remove one, several, all, or the ones with a name. RPMod doesn't keep the
// names, so a state does: saved before rpdump, reloaded after, it finds the effects
// again by what and where they are. Presets tab: alarm, fadeout and camerashake.
//
// Previews are played by this client's own effects system, so nobody else sees
// them. This lives in the engine rather than cgame so it works whatever cgame the
// server's mod ships (RPMod loads its own).

A name goes with the looping effects sent while it is in the form, and sticks to
them once the next list shows them. RPMod doesn't keep it, so a state remembers it:
the effects sent with the manager and the named ones, where the server has them.
Once rpdump load has brought them back, reloading the state finds each one by its
effect and position in a fresh list, and gives it its name again.

waiting at a position, and the map's own. RPMod can't move an effect, so one of the

does it, and the next list gives it its name back under its new number. The list
has no angles: one this manager sent keeps the ones it was sent with, any other goes
